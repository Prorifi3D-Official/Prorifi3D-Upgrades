### 2.1 Bottom Frame

#### 2.1.0 Assemble

- Note that the key to a good and correctly built frame is flatness and alignment.

- In this section, the flat surface you have and the printed part will work as fixtures. They will help you align the frame. 

- Here are the fixtures you will need:

- (pic)

- First, take and place the parts for the bottom frame as follows. Note that there are marks on the printed parts to indicate the orientation.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main1.PNG)

- Use the fixture to help you align the Aluminium profile. The boss on the fixture should fit nicely into the slots of the profiles.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main12.PNG)

- Then put the M8 screws on. Tighten the screws against the table using the four corner fixtures.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main13.PNG)

- Insert an M5x30 screw into the printed parts, and attach the T-nut (3030 M5).

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main4.PNG)

- For T-nut, you should always make sure it is turned 90 degrees correctly before tightening.

- You can check this **[video](https://youtu.be/_kZTA5S2jWY?si=gpDFgc6bVI7_g-RN)** to see how it is done.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main15.PNG)

- A fully tightened T-nut should look like this.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main16.PNG)

- Connect the printed part to the lower frame.Press the profile tightly against the desktop to tighten the corner printed parts, then loosen the M8 screws by about 90 degrees and pull out the fixture. Repeat this for all four corners. 

- Remember to remove the fixture before you proceed to the next step.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main14.PNG)

- Slide the vertical frame into the corner we just assembled. You should align the bottom frame with the profile end surface with a level table surface.

- Then tighten the M8 screws. Note that you should tighten both screws in turn to ensure stress distribution.

- Repeate this for all four corners.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main5.PNG)

#### 2.1.1 Check
- Once you are done, push the bottom frame against your flat working space. It should not bump or make noises when you apply force to each corner. 

### 2.2 Upper Frame
#### 2.2.0 Assemble
- First, take and place the parts for the upper frame as follows. Note that there are marks on the printed parts to indicate the orientation.
 
![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main7.PNG)

- Use the fixture to help you align the Aluminium profile. The steps should fit nicely into the slots of the profiles.
![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main12.PNG)

- Then put the M8 screws on. Tighten the screws against the table using the four corner fixtures.
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main13.PNG)
 
- Insert an M5x30 screw into the printed parts, and attach the T-nut (3030 M5).
  ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main8.PNG)

- Connect the printed part to the upper frame. For T-nut, you should always make sure it is turned 90 degrees correctly before tightening.

- Connect the printed part to the lower frame. Press the profile tightly against the desktop to tighten the corner printed parts, then loosen the M8 screws by about 90 degrees and pull out the fixture. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main14.PNG)

- Repeat this for all four corners. 

- Remember to remove the fixture before you proceed to the next step.

#### 2.2.1 Check
- Make sure the upper frame sit steady on the flat surface.



- Slide the vertical frame into the corner we just assembled. You should align the bottom frame with the profile end surface with a level table surface.
Then tighten the M8 screws. Note that you should tighten both screws in turn to ensure stress distribution.
- Repeate this for all four corners.
 

### 2.3 Frame Assembly
#### 2.3.0 Main Frame
- Now, put the lower frame with vertial beam upside down. 

- Slide the vertical beam into the four corners of the upper frame. Once you are done, the frame should fit nicely.
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main9.PNG)

- Now tighten the M8 screws in turn, making sure each screw applies relatively the same torque.

#### 2.3.1 Check
- Now check the frame. All the screws must be fully tightened. Put the frame in its initial orientation. Apply force on each corner of the upper frame against the flat surface as shown
. 
- The frame should not have any significant bumps or make any noise. Note that the profile straightness and torsion issues can cause slight unevenness. This is fine.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main10.PNG)

#### 2.3.2 Linear Rails
- Linear rails for the Z axis are very important for a 3D printer. We will use jigs and printed parts to ensure the alignment.
- First, attach the M3x10 screw and T-nut to the rail support. This part can determine the position of the rails. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail0.PNG)

- Attach the rail support against the bottom of the frame as shown. Make sure the lower surface is directly against the bottom profiles.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail1.PNG)


- Note that the rail support should be attached to these locations.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail4.PNG)

- Now attach the M3x10 screws and T-nuts (3030 M3) on the rail as shown in the picture. Leave one empty and one placed. If the block or rubber insert blocks your operation. Slide them away and reinsert the rubber blocks at the end of the rail. 

- **Do not let the MGN12 Block drop out!**

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail3.PNG)


- To install the linear rail, you will need the printed fixture. Get them in advance.

- Now, put the rail against the frame as shown and use both of the printed tools to clamp the rail on the frame for alignment.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail2.PNG)

- Tighten the M3 screws in turn. Note that these are T-Nuts. For T-nut, you should always make sure it is turned 90 degrees correctly before tightening.
You can check this **[video](https://youtu.be/_kZTA5S2jWY?si=gpDFgc6bVI7_g-RN)** to see how it is done.

### 2.4 Z-Drive
#### 2.4.0 Pre-insert the nuts
- Attach the M3 hex nuts to the screws and push the nuts until they reach the end. Do this for all Z-drive printed parts. Note that each Z-drive module has a mark on it. They are in pairs, so make sure we do not mix them.
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive1.PNG)

 Insert the M5 nut and then use the **screw-pulling technique**. Screwed the nut in tightly to embed and then remove the screws
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive2.PNG)

#### 2.4.1 Assembly 
- First, put the GT2-188mm timing belt on the largest wheel on the gear module.e
- Take the Z driver gear module and put it inside the slots. It should fit nicely. Note the orientation and then put the upper part as shown.
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive3.PNG)

- Insert the long M3x50 screws as shown and tighten this module. Check if the GT-2 beltsares already on the gears. Tighten all screws properly. Rotate the gears inside. It should spin without any friction.
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive4.PNG)
- Now it's time to attach the footpad. Use an M5 x 20 screw as shown.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive5.PNG)

Now we can prepare the motors. First, we need to insert **M3 nylon insert lock nuts** at the motor mount printed parts as shown. Attach the nut on the M3 screw first anduses it as a guide, then press the nut in with a 4mm hex tool. Remove the screw when you are done.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive6.PNG)

- Note that each motor mount is not the same. This mark shows the pairs it should have. This one, for example, can be matched with #0 or #2 Z-drivers.

- Now put the driving pulley on the motor. Use the jig to help you locate the correct position. 
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive7.PNG)

Then you should attach the motor mount to the motor as shown with M3 x 8 and M3 x 16 screws. Note that the motor wires should be facing upwards.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive8.PNG)

- The Z motors will be attached later. Do not install them at this point.

- Repeat this for all four Z-drives; be careful with the matching.

#### 2.4.2 Attach the Z-drive 
- Now, put the frame upside down,n as we are going to attach the Z-drive module.

- Pre-insert M5 spring nuts into the profiles at the bottom of the frame. You may use the Z-drive module as a jig to locate where these spring nuts should be.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive11.PNG)
- Fix the Z-drive module with M5 x 16 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive12.PNG)

Pass the Z belt as shown. Leaving enough length on both ends. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Z_drive13.PNG)


## 3. Gantry 
### 3.1 The main Gantry
#### 3.1.0 Pre insert the nuts on printed parts
- All gantry parts have marks on them, which should match each other.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main1.PNG)

 - Insert M5 and M3 nuts on each of the gantry main parts (the four big ones)
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main2.PNG).

- There are bumps at the end of the M5 nut holes. This is to make sure the M5 nut stuck nice and tightly. For M5 nuts, use the screw pulling technique to make sure they reach the end. Once you are done, they should not fall out due to gravity. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main3.PNG).


- Do this for all four gantry main body parts. 

#### 3.1.1 Prepare the Z belts
- Take out the Z belts, put them aside for later use
#### 3.1.2 Prepare for assembly
- Find the 2020 profiles for the gantry; there are four of them. Place them as the picture shown. Make sure the marks match the locations. Note that the gantry has an asymmetrical design. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main6.PNG).

#### 3.1.3 Install the Y rails 
- First, attach the M3x8 screws and T-nuts to the rail as shown in the picture. Leave one empty and one placed. If the block or rubber insert blocks your operation. Slide them away and reinsert the rubber blocks at the end of the rail to prevent the block drop off. <span style="color:red">** Dropping out the sliding blocks may result a permenet damage to the linear rail!** <span>

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail3.PNG).

- Now place MGN9 rail guide jig at both ends to help you align the rail to the correct position.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main11.PNG).

- Note that the rail should be centered, and it is slightly shorter than the profile. Neither end of the rail should stick out of the 2020 profile.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main12.PNG).

- Tighten the T-nut properly. For T-nut, you should always make sure it is turned 90 degrees
correctly before tightening.
- You can check this **[video](https://youtu.be/_kZTA5S2jWY?si=gpDFgc6bVI7_g-RN)** to see how it is done.

- Do this for both 401mm profiles.

#### 3.1.4 Assemble the left part of the gantry (Part 1/0)
- First, we need to insert the spring nut.
- This isana M5 spring nut for 2020 profiles. Note that it is not symmetrical. Thus insert nuts can be a bit tricky.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main7.PNG).

- You should insert the correct number of nuts on the profiles to secure them on the printed parts.
For 2 nuts, we recommend that you insert them as shown below.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main8.PNG).

 - For the situation with 3 Nuts, you should replace the middle one with a regular T-nut. Otherwise, there is not enough space. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main9.PNG).

- The amount of nuts required is listed as shown. Follow the arrangement we have earlier.
Proceed after you have all the nuts inserted.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main13.PNG).

 - Once you are done, insert the 2020 profilesinton these locations. Use a hex to help you locate nuts so they can align with the holes on the printed parts. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main14.PNG).

- Next, we need these printed parts labeled with 1/0

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main15.PNG).
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Gantry_main16.PNG).
