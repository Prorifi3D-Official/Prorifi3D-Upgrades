#### 2.0.4 Workspace requirements

- The recommended working space needs to be as flat as possible. A minimum 2m x 1m space is recommended for placing the parts and tools

#### 2.0.5 Aluminium:

- Take out the extruded Aluminum from the Frame box carefully. 

### 2.1 Bottom Frame

#### 2.1.0 Assemble

- Note that the key to a good and correctly built frame is flatness and alignment.

- In this section, the flat surface you have and the printed part will work as fixtures. They will help you align the frame. 

- Here are the fixtures you will need:

- (pic)

- First, take and place the parts for the bottom frame as follows. Note that there are marks on the printed parts to indicate the orientation.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main1.PNG)

- Use the fixture to help you align the Aluminium profile. The boss on the fixture should fit nicely into the slots of the profiles.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main12.PNG)

- Then put the M8 screws on. Tighten the screws against the table using the four corner fixtures.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main13.PNG)

- Insert an M5x30 screw into the printed parts, and attach the T-nut (3030 M5).

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main4.PNG)

- For T-nut, you should always make sure it is turned 90 degrees correctly before tightening.

- You can check this **[video](https://youtu.be/_kZTA5S2jWY?si=gpDFgc6bVI7_g-RN)** to see how it is done.

- A fully tightened T-nut should look like this.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main16.PNG)

- Connect the printed part to the lower frame.Press the profile tightly against the desktop to tighten the corner printed parts, then loosen the M8 screws by about 90 degrees and pull out the fixture. Repeat this for all four corners. 
- Remember to remove the fixture before you proceed to the next step.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main14.PNG)

- Slide the vertical frame into the corner we just assembled. You should align the bottom frame with the profile end surface with a level table surface.
Then tighten the M8 screws. Note that you should tighten both screws in turn to ensure stress distribution.
- Repeate this for all four corners.

![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main5.PNG)

#### 2.1.1 Check
- Once you are done, push the bottom frame against your flat working space. It should not bump or make noises when you apply force to each corner. 

### 2.2 Upper Frame
#### 2.2.0 Assemble
- First, take and place the parts for the upper frame as follows. Note that there are marks on the printed parts to indicate the orientation.
 
![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main7.PNG)

- Use the fixture to help you align the Aluminium profile. The steps should fit nicely into the slots of the profiles.
![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main12.PNG)

- Then put the M8 screws on. Tighten the screws against the table using the four corner fixtures.
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main13.PNG)
 
- Insert an M5x30 screw into the printed parts, and attach the T-nut (3030 M5).
  ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main8.PNG)

- Connect the printed part to the upper frame. For T-nut, you should always make sure it is turned 90 degrees correctly before tightening.

- Connect the printed part to the lower frame. Press the profile tightly against the desktop to tighten the corner printed parts, then loosen the M8 screws by about 90 degrees and pull out the fixture. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main14.PNG)

- Repeat this for all four corners. 

- Remember to remove the fixture before you proceed to the next step.

#### 2.2.1 Check
- Make sure the upper frame sit steady on the flat surface.



- Slide the vertical frame into the corner we just assembled. You should align the bottom frame with the profile end surface with a level table surface.
Then tighten the M8 screws. Note that you should tighten both screws in turn to ensure stress distribution.
- Repeate this for all four corners.
 

### 2.3 Frame Assembly
#### 2.3.0 Main Frame
- Now, put the lower frame with vertial beam upside down. 

- Slide the vertical beam into the four corners of the upper frame. Once you are done, the frame should fit nicely.
 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_main9.PNG)

- Now tighten the M8 screws in turn, making sure each screw applies relatively the same torque.

#### 2.3.1 Check
- Now check the frame. All the screws must be fully tightened. Put the frame in its initial orientation. Apply force on each corner of the upper frame against the flat surface as shown
. 
- The frame should not have any significant bumps or make any noise. Note that the profile straightness and torsion issues can cause slight unevenness. This is fine.

### 2.3.2 Linear Rails
- Linear rails for the Z axis are very important for a 3D printer. We will use jigs and printed parts to ensure the alignment.
- First, attach the M3x10 screw and T-nut to the rail support. This part can determine the position of the rails. 

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail0.PNG)

- Attach the rail support against the bottom of the frame as shown. Make sure the lower surface is directly against the bottom profiles.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail1.PNG)


- Note that the rail support should be attached to these locations.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail4.PNG)

- Now attach the M3x10 screws and T-nuts (3030 M3) on the rail as shown in the picture. Leave one empty and one placed. If the block or rubber insert blocks your operation. Slide them away and reinsert the rubber blocks at the end of the rail. 

- **Do not let the MGN12 Block drop out!**

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail3.PNG)


- To install the linear rail, you will need the printed fixture. Get them in advance.

- Now, put the rail against the frame as shown and use both of the printed tools to clamp the rail on the frame for alignment.

 ![alt alternative text](./src/assets/P350_guide/Frame_rail2.PNG)

- Tighten the M3 screws in turn. Note that these are T-Nuts. For T-nut, you should always make sure it is turned 90 degrees correctly before tightening.
